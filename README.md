# TaskCraft-Empowered-TaskSet-Synthesis
Motivated by the importance of task allocation in real-time systems and the abundance of the existing algorithms, this project aims to explore and compare different techniques for synthesizing multiprocessor tasksets. At the same time we'll also focus on building a GUI for the same, so that the researchers have an ease in developing task sets.
